# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch

In this project, I am going to focus on the following learning objectives:

* Create custom Dataset and DataLoader in PyTorch
* Train a ResNet-18 model in PyTorch to perform Image Classification

By the end of this project, I will create a Convolutional Neural Network, and will train it to classify Chest X-Ray scans 
for Covid-19 with reasonably high accuracy.
